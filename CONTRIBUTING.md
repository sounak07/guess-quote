:+1::tada: First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! :+1::tada:

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to Guess The Quote Project. These are mostly guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

# How Can I Contribute?

* [Feature Development](feature-development)
* [Reporting Bugs](#reporting-bugs)
* [Pull Request](#pull-request)
* [Suggesting Enhancements](#suggesting-enhancements)
* [Your First Code Contribution](your-first-code-contribution)

## Feature Development
First verify if you have added a upstream
`$>git remote -v`<br />
`origin  https://github.com/your-username/guess-quote.git (fetch)`<br />
`origin  https://github.com/your-username/guess-quote.git (push)`<br />
`upstream https://github.com/UdacityMobileWebScholarship/guess-quote.git (fetch)`<br />
`upstream https://github.com/UdacityMobileWebScholarship/guess-quote.git (push)`<br />

#### Steps to Follow:    
1. Start with an updated local development branch -- by checking out the develop branch and pulling changes:    
`git checkout develop`  
`git pull upstream develop`  

2. Create and checkout a feature branch:   
`git checkout -b initials/new-feature-branch-name`  
*Note: LP convention: Your branch name should start with your initials and then a description of your feature (as above).*  

3. Do work in your feature branch, committing early and often:    
`git commit -m "Comment about the commit"`  

4. Rebase frequently to incorporate upstream changes:  
`git fetch upstream`  
`git rebase upstream/develop`          

5. Once you have reviewed your changes, and verified formatting and intention, you can push the changes to your fork:   
`git push -u origin initials/new-feature-branch-name`  

You are now ready to create a Pull Request.
Once you're pull request is successfully accepted make sure to delete the branch on your local filesystem
`$>git branch -d new-feature-branch-name`
